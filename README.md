# Phone Catalog

This is a site-catalod for a hardware store. You can see some goods card on a main page, also you can open the page with details of a choosen good. Now we have only phones, but it's not a problem to add other categories. Also you can choose favoriets or do an order.

This page was created using React, TypeScrips and SASS preprocessor technologies. Also BEM methodology was used during creation this project. Besides it was implemented some libraries like Swiper and Slick carousel.
